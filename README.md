# test_project
A simple repo for me to test algorithms and stuff for interviews and other stuff.

# How to run
```
> git clone git@github.com:Toyz/test_project.git
> cd test_project
> dotnet run quicksort -2 -5 1 0 15 -10 35
```
This should output
```
Unsorted: -2, -5, 1, 0, 15, -10, 35
Sorted: -10, -5, -2, 0, 1, 15, 35
QuickSort took XXms to process
```
